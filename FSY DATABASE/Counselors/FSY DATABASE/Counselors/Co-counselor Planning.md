After introductions you may wish to discuss:

• How to be on time or early to all events
• Whether your group wants to establish a meeting spot for dances and meals
• Who will lead the introduction of company name discussion during Meet
Your Company
• Who will lead goal setting during family home evening
• Who will lead gospel study each day
• How you will conduct invitation to reverence and testimony tips
• How you will conduct the company Reflect and Review on day five
• Whether you need your co-counselor to cover any assignments for you on
the duty roster
• Whether you want to take turns accompanying your participants to classes
• How to learn your participants’ names before they arrive
• When you might pray for participants by name throughout the week
After you have finished planning, use the remaining time to socialize with other
counselors and to prepare door tags (if desired). Door tags are small signs
personalized with participants’ names that counselors hang on the doors of the
participants’ assigned rooms.
Write on the tags the time and place at which the youth should meet you for
Meet Your Counselor. Use paint-safe tape to hang the door tags.
Remember to get plenty of sleep.
