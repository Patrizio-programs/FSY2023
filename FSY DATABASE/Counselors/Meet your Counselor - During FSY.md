Meet Your Counselor is one of the most important activities of the week because

it is the first time you meet and interact with your youth. You will have approxi-
mately one hour to set the tone for the rest of the week and to help your partic-
ipants catch the vision of what can happen at FSY. Help them see what kinds of

opportunities and experiences are available to them. You can do this by:
• Showing love and kindness. Express your appreciation and excitement.
• Helping the youth get comfortable with one another and with you. Conduct
introductions or use an activity or game to help everyone get to know one
another and learn names. Invite the youth to participate in all activities and
to spend as much time together as possible during the week. The faster
your group can become unified, the more likely you are to accomplish your
goals for the week.
• Inviting the Spirit. Help your youth see that our principal purposes this
week at FSY are to come closer to Christ, feel the Spirit, and strengthen our
testimonies. Share a scripture with them, and bear your testimony. Promise
them that blessings will come and that they will feel the Spirit this week as
they strive to participate both socially and spiritually.
• Explaining FSY policies and rules.
◦ Go through the rules checklist in the participant handbook.
◦ Discuss dress and appearance expectations.
◦ Ask how you can help the participants have a great week, and respond
to their suggestions.
