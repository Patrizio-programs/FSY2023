Because counselors are with the youth more than any of the other staff mem-
bers, they are vitally important at FSY. As a counselor, you will be expected to

be a good shepherd and to pray for the youth and interact with them as much as
possible.
At FSY, you will oversee a “counselor group” of about 10–12 participants of your
same gender. You will also be assigned at least one co-counselor of the opposite
gender. Together, your counselor groups will form a company. You will conduct
many activities with your counselor group alone, although several activities will
be conducted in companies, overseen by both you and your co-counselor(s).

An assistant coordinator will be assigned to oversee you and a few other coun-
selors. Get to know your assistant coordinator, and feel free to ask questions and

request help as needed.
